These programs were created by a summer undergraduate workshop 
funded by ILR to create variable and value labels based on public-use
information for the CPS and to attach these to the zero-obs confidential data files.

When a variable is not labelled, or no value labels exist, the variable itself could not be
found in public-use information.

These programs and data are provided with no guarantees.
