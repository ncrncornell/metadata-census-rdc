File structure for person files:

The p files are non-GQ households and the t files include everyone 
(GQ and non-GQ). The t files have an x in the file name (rather than 
an underscore) to indicate that some fields have been suppressed (namely
the household-level variables on the gq records).

The variable labels and value labels stem from the PU files.
